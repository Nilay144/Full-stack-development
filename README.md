# Full Stack Development

This repository contains sample projects for learning full-stack web development. Each project demonstrates how to combine front-end and back-end technologies to create a functional application.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch a local server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project

Currently, the repository features a simple travel itinerary planner with a minimal AI-based suggestion engine.
